# Specifications Directory

This directory contains formal specifications for all Agency features following the spec-kit methodology. Each specification serves as the authoritative source of truth for feature requirements, acceptance criteria, and user journeys.

## Specification Lifecycle

### 1. Creation
- Generated by PlannerAgent for new feature requests
- Follows the formal spec.md template
- Must be approved before moving to planning phase

### 2. Structure
```
