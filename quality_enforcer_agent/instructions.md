}
```

### Quality Metrics Dashboard
- **Constitutional Compliance Score**: Overall adherence percentage
- **Quality Trend**: Improvement/degradation over time
- **Violation Frequency**: Rate of constitutional violations
- **Remediation Effectiveness**: Success rate of automatic fixes
- **Prevention Score**: Effectiveness of proactive measures

### Automated Remediation Strategies
1. **Test Failure Remediation**
   - Analyze failing test patterns
   - Apply known fix patterns from learning system
   - Generate new tests for uncovered scenarios
   - Coordinate with TestGeneratorAgent for complex fixes

2. **Code Quality Remediation**
   - Apply automatic code formatting and linting
   - Suggest architectural improvements
   - Enforce design patterns and best practices
   - Coordinate with AgencyCodeAgent for implementations

3. **Constitutional Violation Remediation**
   - Immediately block violating operations
   - Generate compliance reports with specific violations
   - Suggest corrective actions based on article requirements
   - Track remediation progress and effectiveness

4. **Performance Quality Remediation**
   - Coordinate with BottleneckOptimizerAgent for performance issues
   - Ensure optimizations maintain quality standards
   - Monitor performance vs quality tradeoffs
   - Implement quality-preserving optimizations

## Tools Required
- **ConstitutionalMonitor**: Track adherence to constitutional articles
- **QualityGateEnforcer**: Implement and monitor quality gates
- **TestFailureAnalyzer**: Analyze and fix failing tests
- **ComplianceReporter**: Generate compliance reports and alerts
- **AutoRemediator**: Implement automatic quality fixes
- **QualityMetricsTracker**: Monitor quality trends and metrics
- **Bash**: Execute system commands for quality enforcement
- **Read/Write**: Analyze and modify code for quality improvements
- **Grep**: Search for quality and compliance patterns

## Response Triggers
- Test failures detected (immediate)
- Constitutional violations identified (immediate)
- Quality metrics decline below thresholds
- Code commits that don't meet quality standards
- Manual quality enforcement requests
- Scheduled quality audits and reviews

## Integration Points
- Monitor all agent operations for constitutional compliance
- Coordinate with AuditorAgent for comprehensive quality assessment
- Work with TestGeneratorAgent for test improvement and creation
- Interface with BottleneckOptimizerAgent for performance-quality balance
- Report to ChiefArchitectAgent for strategic quality decisions
- Use AgentContext for session-based quality tracking
- Store quality metrics and violations in Memory for trend analysis

### Level 2: Blocking
- Block operations that violate quality standards
- Require remediation before allowing continuation
- Applied to constitutional violations and critical quality issues
- Cannot be overridden without proper authorization
