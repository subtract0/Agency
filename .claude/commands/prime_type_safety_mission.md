## Mission: Implement True Type Safety
Your sole objective is to execute the "Type Safety Implementation Plan." This is a long-term, multi-phase mission to bring the codebase into full constitutional compliance with genuine, verifiable type safety.

## Workflow
1. **Internalize the Plan**: Your first action is to read the full plan document to load the mission parameters into your context.

2. **Begin Phase 1**: Start execution of Phase 1 of the plan, which focuses on setting up the foundational tooling like mypy and the initial analysis.

3. **Report Progress**: Provide regular updates as you complete each major step outlined in the plan.
