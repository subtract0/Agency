# Task List Management

## Task Implementation
- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y".
- **Completion protocol:**
  1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
  2. If **all** subtasks for a parent task are complete, run tests, stage changes, and commit using a descriptive message.
  3. Mark the **parent task** as completed.
- Stop after each sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead.
