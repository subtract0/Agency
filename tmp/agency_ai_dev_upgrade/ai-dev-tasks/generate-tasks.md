# Rule: Generating a Task List from a PRD

## Goal
To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step task list in Markdown format based on an existing Product Requirements Document (PRD).

## Process
1.  **Receive PRD Reference:** The user points the AI to a specific PRD file.
2.  **Analyze PRD:** Read and analyze the functional requirements and user stories.
3.  **Assess Current State:** Review the existing codebase to understand architecture and identify relevant files.
4.  **Phase 1: Generate Parent Tasks:** Create high-level tasks and present them to the user for confirmation.
5.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause and wait for the user to respond with "Go".
6.  **Phase 2: Generate Sub-Tasks:** Break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks.
