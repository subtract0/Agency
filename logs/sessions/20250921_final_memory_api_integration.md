## Integration Points

The Memory API has been integrated into:
- **Agency System** - `/Users/am/Code/Agency/agency.py`
- **Planner Agent** - `/Users/am/Code/Agency/planner_agent/planner_agent.py`
- **Code Agent** - `/Users/am/Code/Agency/agency_code_agent/agency_code_agent.py`
- **System Hooks** - `/Users/am/Code/Agency/shared/system_hooks.py`

## Ready for Push

All files are committed and the branch is ready for push to remote repository. The .DS_Store files remain uncommitted as intended (now in gitignore).

## Next Steps

1. Push to remote repository using provided commands
2. Create pull request for Memory API integration
3. Review and merge to main branch
4. Deploy Memory API capabilities to production
