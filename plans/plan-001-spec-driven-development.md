## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

#### Risk 1: Spec-kit process creates excessive overhead for development velocity
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Clear workflow decision tree with simple task bypass, performance monitoring
- **Contingency Plan**: Adjust complexity thresholds, streamline templates if needed

#### Risk 2: Agent instruction updates break existing functionality
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Incremental instruction updates, comprehensive testing, rollback capability
- **Contingency Plan**: Revert to previous instructions, isolate changes, gradual re-deployment

### Operational Risks

#### Risk 3: Templates become too complex for effective agent usage
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Iterative template refinement, usage pattern monitoring, agent feedback
- **Contingency Plan**: Simplify templates, provide additional guidance, create template helpers

#### Risk 4: Constitutional compliance becomes development blocker
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Automated compliance checking, clear violation resolution guidance
- **Contingency Plan**: Streamline compliance process, provide quick resolution paths

### Constitutional Risks

#### Risk 5: Article II compliance compromised during rapid spec-kit adoption
