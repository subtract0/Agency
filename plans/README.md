# Plans Directory

This directory contains technical implementation plans for approved specifications following the spec-kit methodology. Each plan details the architecture, agent assignments, tools, and contracts required to implement the corresponding specification.

## Planning Lifecycle

### 1. Creation
- Generated by PlannerAgent after specification approval
- Follows the formal plan.md template
- Must be approved before task breakdown

### 2. Structure
```

### 3. Plan Components
- **Architecture**: High-level system design
- **Agent Assignments**: Which agents handle which components
- **Tool Requirements**: Specific tools needed for implementation
- **Contracts**: APIs, interfaces, and communication protocols
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing and validation strategy
- **Risk Mitigation**: Potential issues and solutions

### 4. Approval Process
- Plans reviewed for technical feasibility
- Resource allocation validated
- Constitutional compliance verified
- Approved plans proceed to task breakdown

## Constitutional Compliance

All plans MUST adhere to:
- **Article I**: Complete architectural context
- **Article II**: 100% quality assurance strategy
- **Article III**: Automated enforcement integration
- **Article IV**: Learning system integration
- **Article V**: Spec-driven development process

## Quality Standards

- **Detailed Architecture**: Clear system design and components
- **Resource Planning**: Accurate agent and tool assignments
- **Quality Integration**: NECESSARY test framework compliance
- **Risk Assessment**: Identified challenges and mitigation strategies
- **Constitutional Alignment**: Full compliance with Agency constitution

## Integration

Plans integrate with:
- **Specs Directory**: Source specifications for requirements
- **TodoWrite System**: Granular task breakdown for implementation
- **Agent System**: Clear role assignments and handoffs
- **Learning System**: Pattern application and extraction
- **Quality Assurance**: Test strategy and validation approach
