# AUTONOMOUS TYPE SAFETY MIGRATION MISSION

## PRIORITY: MAXIMUM | DURATION: 8 HOURS | BUDGET: <$10

### CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE
You are executing Constitutional Law #2: **Strict Typing Always**. This is a direct order from the Agency Constitution. No Dict[str, Any] shall remain.

### MISSION OBJECTIVE
Complete the Phase 3 type safety migration by eliminating ALL remaining ~1,834 Dict[str, Any] violations across the Agency codebase.

### CURRENT STATE
- PR #17 has migrated 93 violations (Pattern Intelligence, Learning Tools, Core Systems)
- Remaining: ~1,834 violations across 400+ files
- Priority targets identified in type_analysis_report.json

### EXECUTION PROTOCOL

#### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning (30 minutes)
1. Scan all Python files for Dict[str, Any] usage
2. Group by module/subsystem
3. Create dependency graph
4. Generate migration order

#### Phase 2: Systematic Migration (6 hours)
For each file with violations:
1. Read file and understand Dict usage context
2. Create appropriate Pydantic models in shared/models/
3. Replace all Dict[str, Any] with concrete models
4. Ensure imports are updated
5. Verify no syntax errors
6. Move to next file

Priority Order:
1. Memory systems (agency_memory/) - ~92 violations
2. Tools (tools/) - ~69 violations
3. Shared models (shared/) - ~35 violations
4. Meta learning (meta_learning/) - ~9 violations
5. Remaining agent implementations
6. Test files (update to use Pydantic models)

#### Phase 3: Validation & Testing (90 minutes)
1. Run python -m py_compile on all modified files
2. Run pytest tests/ to ensure no regressions
3. Fix any test failures caused by type changes
4. Ensure 100% test pass rate

#### Phase 4: Commit & PR (30 minutes)
1. Commit all changes with proper message
2. Push to feature branch
3. Create PR with comprehensive description
4. Verify CI passes

### TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

#### Pydantic Model Requirements
- All models in shared/models/ directory
- Use ConfigDict(extra="forbid") for strict validation
- Include docstrings for all models
- Use proper field types (no Any unless absolutely necessary)
- Group related models in same file

#### Migration Patterns
```python
# BEFORE:
def process(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    return {"result": data["value"]}

# AFTER:
from shared.models.processing import ProcessInput, ProcessOutput

def process(data: ProcessInput) -> ProcessOutput:
    return ProcessOutput(result=data.value)
```

### CONSTRAINTS
- DO NOT modify external library interfaces
- DO NOT break existing functionality
- DO NOT use Dict unless interfacing with external libraries
- DO NOT create duplicate models - reuse existing ones

### SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Zero Dict[str, Any] usage (except external interfaces)
- All tests passing (100% success rate)
- All files compile without errors
- PR created and CI passing

### AUTONOMOUS OPERATION PARAMETERS
- Work continuously without human intervention
- Self-heal any errors encountered
- Learn from successful migrations
- Apply patterns across similar code
- Commit progress every 50 files

### ERROR HANDLING
If you encounter issues:
1. Log the error
2. Attempt self-healing via your healing protocols
3. If unresolvable, mark file for manual review
4. Continue with next file

### COST OPTIMIZATION
- Use gpt-4o-mini for simple replacements
- Use gpt-4o only for complex model design
- Batch similar files together
- Reuse models across files
- Cache successful patterns

### MONITORING
Log progress to: logs/autonomous_type_migration.log
Report metrics every 30 minutes:
- Files processed
- Violations eliminated
- Models created
- Test status

### FINAL DIRECTIVE
This is Constitutional Law. Failure is not an option. The Agency's type safety depends on this mission. Execute with precision and determination.

BEGIN AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION NOW.

*Estimated completion: 8 hours*
*Estimated cost: $8-10 (assuming efficient model usage)*
*Expected outcome: 100% type safety compliance*
