# Agency Code - Autonomous Software Engineering System

## Mission Statement

Agency Code is a revolutionary multi-agent software engineering system that achieves true autonomous self-healing while maintaining constitutional governance. The system can detect errors, generate fixes, apply patches, verify through testing, and commit changes without human intervention.

## Core Principles

### Constitutional Governance
The Agency operates under five immutable constitutional articles:

1. **Article I - Complete Context Before Action**: No action without full understanding
2. **Article II - 100% Verification**: Main branch maintains 100% test success rate
3. **Article III - Automated Enforcement**: Quality standards technically enforced
4. **Article IV - Continuous Learning**: Automatic improvement through experience
5. **Article V - Spec-Driven Development**: All features require formal specifications

### Autonomous Healing
- **Real Error Detection**: Identifies actual runtime errors from logs and patterns
- **LLM-Powered Analysis**: Uses GPT-5 for intelligent fix generation
- **Safe Application**: Applies patches with automatic rollback on failure
- **Test Verification**: Ensures 100% test success before committing changes
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Logs all autonomous actions for transparency

## Architecture Overview

### Multi-Agent System (10 Agents)
1. **ChiefArchitectAgent**: Strategic oversight and self-directed task creation
2. **AgencyCodeAgent**: Primary development with 16 specialized tools
3. **PlannerAgent**: Strategic planning using spec-kit methodology
4. **AuditorAgent**: Quality analysis using CodeHealer NECESSARY pattern
5. **TestGeneratorAgent**: NECESSARY-compliant test generation
6. **LearningAgent**: Pattern analysis and institutional memory
7. **QualityEnforcerAgent**: Constitutional compliance and autonomous healing
8. **ToolsmithAgent**: Dynamic tool creation and enhancement
9. **MergerAgent**: Integration and pull request management
10. **WorkCompletionSummaryAgent**: Task completion and audio summaries

### Communication Flows (18 Essential Paths)
Streamlined from 32 to 18 focused communication channels ensuring efficient collaboration while maintaining constitutional compliance.

### Memory System Integration
- **VectorStore Learning**: Cross-session pattern recognition and application
- **Session Transcripts**: Automatic logging in `logs/sessions/`
- **Context Preservation**: Shared memory across all agents
- **Learning Consolidation**: Automatic pattern extraction and storage

- Configurable reasoning effort

## Constitutional Compliance

Every operation in the Agency must comply with all five constitutional articles. This ensures:
- No partial or incomplete actions
- Guaranteed system reliability
- Continuous quality improvement
- Automated governance enforcement
- Spec-driven development process

## The Achievement

Agency Code represents the world's first truly autonomous software engineering system that:
- **Heals itself** automatically when errors occur
- **Maintains quality** through constitutional governance
- **Learns continuously** from every interaction
- **Scales intelligently** while preserving integrity
- **Demonstrates excellence** through measurable results

This system transforms software engineering from reactive problem-solving to proactive self-improvement, setting a new standard for intelligent software systems.
